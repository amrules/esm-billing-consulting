It would not be an exaggeration to say that \n                I thoroughly detested the business side of medicine as much as I enjoyed taking care of my patients.\n                 Unfortunately, as you could not do one without the other, I did not have much of a choice. The first \n                 few years were rocky with a high turnover of office staff, many of whom did not have prior medical\n                  office experience. I initially used a billing service but then an attempt to do it in-house was \n                  unsuccessful. About 11 years ago, you started doing my billing and that continues until the present time.\n                   Thinking back about it, this has been one of the most enduring relationships over my years in practice. \n                   Not even once since, do I recall having entertained a change of my billing service. In spite of the \n                   disheartening complexity of the system, I always had the comfort of knowing that I had a reliable partner\n                    who helped us navigate the rough waters. I have always admired the skill and consistency with which you \n                    and your staff handled our billing. Your choice of staff has been excellent and when I visited your \n                    office recently, I was impressed by the professional yet collegial atmosphere there. I often \n                    regarded your interaction with my own office staff as a stabilizing influence at times of stress. \n                    Additionally, I appreciated that the periodic reports you gave me contained the important information \n                    without inundating me with useless details. Your advice has been very valuable in many of the business \n                    decisions I made. A tribute to your good management is that in spite of the growth of your billing \n                    agency, the quality of the service you provide has not declined. I've only received positive feedback \n                    from the physicians I referred to you.\n            </p>\n            <p class=\"left-align light\">\n                In conclusion, I would like to thank you Beth for the many services that you and your agency have \n                provided me with over the years. Your contributions were vital to the success of my practice. I wish you \n                all the best and keep up the good work!\n            </p>\n            <p class=\"left-align light\">\n                Maged Hussein, MD\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"divider\"></div>\n            \n            <p class=\"left-align light\">\n                On July 31st 2018 we closed our independent practice of Pediatrics of forty nine years In Reston, \n                VIrginia. The intention of this letter is to recommend ESM Billing & Consulting Inc. Until twenty one \n                years ago we did our billing with several other companies with multiple results, none of which we found \n                satisfactory.\n            </p>\n            <p class=\"left-align light\">\n                Then in 1997 we found Ms. Beth McClenahan, founder and owner of ESM. Throughout all these years their \n                billing, collection and consulting have been extremely honest, reliable and dependable. Our practice \n                beneffited tremendously with their services.\n            </p>\n            <p class=\"left-align light\">\n                Very truly yours, <br>\n                Guillermo A Trémols, MD <br>\n                René F.
